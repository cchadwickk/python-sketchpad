# Details
The project is aimed to provide an understanding of Human Computer interactions and their limitations.
By having to design these funcionalities, the programmer has to identify how the users choices flows them through states of the program.
And also the number of inputs and the best ways to allow the user to transfer their thought process to the program.

It is a 2-D drawing space with following functionalities.
- A mode to draw sketches using scribbled freehand lines 
- A mode to draw straight lines 
- A mode to draw rectangles 
- A mode to draw ellipses 
- A mode to draw special cases of these (squares and circles) 
- A mode to draw polygons (open and closed polygons) 

In addition, the user is able to select a colour for any of the graphical objects that are about to be drawn. Furthermore, the user should has a selection method so that they can identify an object that has already been drawn and perform the following operations: 

- Move the selected object to a new location 
- Cut the object from the drawing (delete a graphical object) 
- Paste the selected object (copy and paste) to a new location 

There is also a functionality to: 

- Group the object with another object (possibly creating groups of arbitrary objects) 
- Ungroup a set of objects that have been grouped 

The user can also save the drawing and reload them later on.
